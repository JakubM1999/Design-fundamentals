        <!-- Color Theory -->
        <section class="section1">
            <h1>Color Theory</h1>
            <div>
                <p>Meaning of color theory is the set of rules that every designer uses as guidelines which
                helps them to communicate with users or consumers. That means that diffrend colors evokes
                diffrend emotions in people. Let´s take color <strong class="blue">Blue</strong> as a exemple this color
                represtents both sky and the sea and gives us this sense of open spaces, freedom and sensitivity,
                but also gives us this feeling of trust, faith, wisdom and stability, so diffrend companies and 
                designer use this technique to mabey gain certain group of customer´s trust, and that´s how color
                theory works.

        <!-- Typography -->

        <section class="section2">
            <h1>Typography</h1>
            <div>
                <p>The definition of tyopgraphy is the art and technique of making written language readable 
                and appealing when displayed. Like colors typography can evoke diffrend emotions in people
                very good exemple is <strong class="typo-love">I Will Find You</strong> and 
                <strong class="typo-scary">I Will Find You</strong>. See the diffrence? In typography are also 
                very important point sizes, line lengths, line-spacings and letter-spacing that has a very big 
                but suttle impact on how we see and read letters.

        <!-- Iconography -->

        <section class="section3">
            <h1>Iconography</h1>
            <div>
                <p>From what I understand about iconography is that it started for example on christian
                religious paintings when the image on the painting represtents something like the dove
                that represtents the holy spirit. But we can also see how that transisioned to the modern
                world where we use icons to express emotions and we see how much inpact it has on our
                culture today because if you imagined the text masseges without using emojis it feels
                wierd. So in short terms iconography lets us express our self or simbolize something.

        <!-- Interactivity Design -->

        <section class="section4">
            <h1>Interactivity Design</h1>
            <div>
                <p>Interactivity design or often called IxD is all about user Interactivity with the product,
                    it is when a technology products are designed to center on human behavior, interaction 
                    and utilization of a product. IxD enables the building of a technology product by focusing
                    on its visiual interface and interaction, rather than the "hardcoding" aspect of a softwere.

        <!-- Animation Design -->

        <section class="section5">
            <h1 class="animation" data-text="Animation" >Animation</h1>
            <div>
                <p>Animation Design it is an art an art of creating special effects and other designes for 
                various forms of media like movies, video games and even social media posts and not only that.
                Why do we use it on websites though? well since website design drastically improved through
                diffrend tools, animation have been apart of this. Nowadays they are used to create eye-catching
                website to create better conversions and attract users to buy, click, and view things on our websites.
                Animation is also helpful to distract the user while the content loads, making it seem to be 
                quicker while also allowing them to see movement or progress up front.
